# VIDEO-CHAT-APP
Introducing our innovative video chat application, inspired by Microsoft Teams, built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and UUID. 

Our app brings you a seamless communication experience with an array of powerful features. With real-time chat capabilities, users can exchange messages instantly while participating in video calls. The unique room ID system allows any number of people to create and join rooms, enabling efficient collaboration across teams.

The app supports high-quality video calls akin to enterprise-level systems, and even allows users to share their screens for presentations or demonstrations. Additionally, users can record their screens, collaborate on a shared whiteboard, and take advantage of an enhanced security system to protect their conversations. With an integrated logger, users can keep track of important discussions and actions. Lastly, our app is hosted on Heroku, ensuring reliable availability and scalability.
